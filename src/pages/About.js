      <hr></hr>
      This site is, first and foremost, an opportunity the Lord has given me to
      assist and serve others with technology. Watermark Community Church in
      Dallas is my home church and I get the opportunity to serve with the 4pm
      service and Legacy group on occasion. I graduated with a BS in CS from
      Texas Tech in 2019 and worked as IT support on-campus for dorm hall
      students for 4 years. I wanted to use that experience to create and
      maintain this website to help out those who are less technologically
      inclined. This site offers helpful tech tips, info and streamlines
      resolving common issues with modern tech. Along with the tips, helpful
      links to brand websites are provided.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      If you have any suggestions, feedback, or additions to the site, please
      send them to the email address below.<br></br> I'm also available for
      local in-person IT appointments (with hourly service fee) should this
      website not suffice.
