      This site is, first and foremost, an opportunity the Lord has given me to
      assist and serve others with technology. I wanted to use my experience
      with IT support and CS degree to create this website to help out those who
      are less technologically inclined. This site offers helpful tips and
      streamlines resolving common issues with modern tech. Along with the tips,
      helpful links to brand websites are provided.
